I am interested in understanding the structures and functions of various Complex Systems from social networks to biological systems.  
To reach my goal, I use simple models in Statistical Physics and Network Science.  
Recently, I am trying to bring Machine Learning into my research for a better understanding of complex systems and seeking to apply these to solve real-world problems.
